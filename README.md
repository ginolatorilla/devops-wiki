# Gino's DevOps Wiki

Everything that I know related to DevOps.

🌏 See it live at <https://devops-wiki.pages.dev>.

## Requirements

- Hugo 0.138.0

## Publishing a post

This page uses the [Congo](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/) Hugo theme.
Run the `hugo server` command to preview your work and to check if your changes are acceptable.

When you push your changes to the `main` branch, [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) will pick them up and
deploy them live.
